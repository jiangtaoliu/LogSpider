# LogSpider
Gather thousands of logs from your infrastructure in real time without any agents, or configuration while staying within a few percent of CPU usage and few Kb of ingress bandwidth.

Imagine syslog that works out of the box without setup, and with any application, never misses log events and collects them all in one place.

# Usage
```bash
LogSpider -i ip1-ipN -o outfile.log
```
